          <h2><strong>Unlocking The Mind</strong></h2>

          <h3>Abstract of the Talk:</h3>
          <p>Meditation has often been studied as a spiritual mind-body practice that has shown promising impact on Brain and Behaviour across illness-to-wellness spectrum. During this talk I hope to highlight the fact that Meditation is a universal human ability, which when goes maladaptive causes suffering. The neuroscience behind day-to-day meditative process will be examined alongside those seen in practitioners of various mind-body practices. Some of the insights from studies conducted on proficient meditators at NIMHANS during wake and sleep, will be shared. The talk will also highlight the need to rethink some of the neuroscience concepts and approaches, such that the promising impact of meditation can be understood and be applied.</p>

          <h3>Rutheesh</h3>
          <p>We all know the multitude of benefits one derives from doing meditative practice. But it is also difficult at times to keep the practice going. That's where a like minded community helps. That's what Inventure is, a club for people interested in meditation. Friday sessions help beginners to slowly make meditation their habit and adepts to strengthen their practice. Also, when many people meditate together it is a different experience. I am very passionate about meditating and helping interested people to start with meditation, hence I became a core member.</p>

          <h3>Pushkar Mishra</h3>
          <p>I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the meditation sessions I've attended over the past few weeks. Participating in these sessions has been an incredibly enriching experience for me, and I wanted to share some of the reasons why I found them so beneficial. Firstly, I appreciate the calming and welcoming atmosphere that you and your team cultivate during each session. From the moment I walk in, I feel a sense of peace and tranquility that allows me to fully immerse myself in the practice. Moreover, the guidance throughout the meditation sessions has been invaluable. Gentle instructions and insightful prompts have helped me deepen my practice and explore new aspects of mindfulness and self-awareness. I particularly appreciate the way you tailor each session to address different themes and techniques, keeping the practice fresh and engaging. I've also noticed tangible benefits from incorporating meditation into my routine. Not only do I feel more relaxed and centered during the sessions themselves, but I've also noticed an increased sense of clarity and focus in my daily life. I find myself better equipped to manage stress and navigate challenges with a greater sense of ease and resilience. Overall, I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to participate in these meditation sessions. Thank you for creating such a nurturing and supportive environment for growth and self-discovery. I look forward to continuing my journey with meditation and further exploring its transformative potential. Looking forward to attending such amazing sessions...!!</p>

          <p>It was great attending the group meditation sessions organized by Inventure Club. I practice meditation alone in my hostel room. However, the experience I have had in the group meditation sessions is amazing. Thanks to Inventure Club for organizing group meditation sessions. I hope this will continue.</p>

          <p>Hello Inventure Club! The last talk from NIMHANS was very insightful. I had been seeking such an explanation or learning of neuroscience and our mind, and my curiosity was satiated by the talk. I expect more such upcoming interactive sessions (especially if we could get some practical experience on working of our mind like EEG etc).</p>

          <p>I have been regularly attending the sessions conducted by Inventure Club and they are extremely beneficial. Really appreciate that Dr. Purini comes every week and conducts these wonderful interactive sessions. I look forward to the group meditation every Friday because I feel very peaceful and relaxed. The discussions which we have about different aspects like improving focus, mental health, improving sleep quality etc are also very important and the tips we get are very helpful. These sessions have really helped in making meditation a part of my routine and I am really grateful for that.</p>

          <h3>Naveen</h3>
          <p>Dear Dr. Jyothi Vedurada IITH mam, I have attended GSM yesterday for the first time. It was very pleasant and new experience. The panel discussions from global spiritual leaders were enlightening. The place itself is peaceful and soothing. There are separate places for meditation, and people out there were helping out with practical sessions on heartfulness meditation. However, it was super crowded due to GSM and people came from all over the world from different religions, so I wasn't able to sit and do meditation there. But, I guess during normal days it's so peaceful to visit. Overall, it was a diff exp being around people talking about inner peace and spirituality. Thank you so much for sharing this and letting me know. Naveen also shared a few pictures with us of his visit to Kanha during GSM.</p>

          <h3>Tamal Mondal</h3>
          <p>I really appreciate all the efforts made by the Inventure team and trainers in organizing the physical sessions every week and teaching from very basic to everyone. One small feedback from my end would be if the sessions can be more target/goal driven (like the one organized to improve productivity) and if there are more activities (I totally understand that with meditation, achieving it is difficult as it's all about being peaceful and stay calm) to make it helpful along with fun and opportunity to network, then it might be more interesting to continue for the students who have a perception that meditation doesn't work or it's boring.</p>

          <h3>Shubham Chatterjee</h3>
          <p>Here are my suggestions:<br>
          1. Yoga Sessions should be conducted regularly. There are many open places in the new sports complex beside the Gym (on the first floor) where it can be done. It just needs a little bit of cleaning because of the accumulated dust of construction.<br>
          2. We can have some reading sessions (maybe any type of books like story books and not just spiritual, just to make our mind light and fresh after the session).<br>
          3. We can also sometimes have many feel-good shorts films or biopics of some great people that we can watch together during the sessions.</p>

          <h3>Arpit Shrimankar</h3>
          <p>The guidance provided for practicing mindfulness meditation in overcoming problems is insightful and practical. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on the breath, acknowledging negative thoughts without judgment, and cultivating compassion towards oneself and others. The suggestion to breathe in strength and release tension with each exhale is particularly helpful. Meditation as mindfulness is a tool for finding clarity, resilience, and inner peace in the face of challenges of daily life. It helps me to keep calm in every situation.</p>

          <p>I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the chance to be part of the Inventure Meditation Club at IITH. The warm and inclusive environment, along with the expert guidance in heartfulness meditation and cleansing techniques, has significantly enhanced my overall well-being. I value the diversity of practices and the supportive community atmosphere. I eagerly anticipate participating in more transformative sessions. Further, I would like to specially thank Dr. Jyothi Vedurada mam, and all the team for your dedication and efforts in making this experience truly enriching.</p>

          <p>I liked how the Inventure club has taken a forward step towards a nice meditation club, however it might be a wise idea if we include some games, reading sessions and we do it under an open sky instead of a room. I overall liked the whole idea.</p>
